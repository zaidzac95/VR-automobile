# FAQ / Known Issues
## Frequently Asked Questions
#### Is this plugin compatible with VR Toolkit?
Yes! VRTK currently uses a simpler version of VRTP for tunnelling. If you wish to use the full features of VRTP, just ensure that you don't use the version included with VRTK at the same time.

Please note - VRTP is in no way affiliated with VR Toolkit.

#### I have a question / feature request / bug report!
Ok, not a question, but sure. There are two ways to get in touch - either email us at <mailto:support-vrtp@sigtrapgames.com> or post on our [Unity forum thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/upcoming-vr-tunnelling-pro-plug-and-play-vr-comfort.517537/).

Please note we cannot guarantee we'll implement every feature request or bug fix but we'll do our best!
